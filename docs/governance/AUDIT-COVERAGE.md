## Gap Analysis

### High Priority (Needs Re-Audit)

1. **None at this time.** (Silo 4 vector store was audited and confirmed as a future milestone gap).

### Medium Priority (Rarely Audited)

1. **None at this time.** (Silo 2 Hand tool acquisition cost verified).

---

### High Risk (Most Violations)

1. **All core silos (1-7) have been significantly hardened as of 2026-05-01.** Risk levels have been downgraded based on comprehensive remediation of cross-silo leaks, race conditions, and cognitive safety gaps.

---

## Audit Best Practices for Future Agents

1. **Principle 13/15 First**: Prioritize checking `ConditionExpression` and `ADD` patterns in DynamoDB.
2. **Multi-Tenancy Scoping**: Verify `workspaceId` propagation in all cross-silo events.
3. **Automated Verification**: Always run `pnpm principles` and update the rule list in `scripts/quality/verify-principles.ts` to include new patterns.
4. **Track Recurrence**: Use `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` to prevent regression of fixed P1 issues.

## Anti-Patterns Identified

See `docs/governance/ANTI-PATTERNS.md` for recurring issues to avoid.
